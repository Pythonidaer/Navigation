# Imitation Navigation
*Attempt to recreate a Navigation I found through sitespire, as well as experiment with text-to-svg logo design with Figma*

## Current Progress:
[View Webpage Here](https://pythonidaer.github.io/Navigation/)

## Technologies used:
- Figma
- Inspector Console
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- VSCode

This project was meant to build something with nothing more than looking at a website and its available Inspector code. I didn't put a whole lot of effort into the hamburger menu, because the only goal of this project was to find a way for text to fit a container exactly as wide as flexbox navigation items. I found this was possible with SVG, but I am not sure how I would have done it with CSS (maybe with `clamp`).
