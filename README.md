I am trying to create a navigation bar from scratch. I'm also practicing GitHub and the terminal on my Windows PC, so am working on:
1) building a repo
2) cloning it to my PC
3) 'touch'-ing files from the command line
4) coding the navigation in VS
5) using git commands to push the final product to GitHub
